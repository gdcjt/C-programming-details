//    details when you use 'new' in construction
//1.when you use 'new' in a construction, you should use 'delete' in the destruction at the same time
//2.'new' and 'delete' should be the same form(both with '[]', or neither)
//3.if you creat more than one construction, all constructions should use 'new' with the same form
//4.you should define a copy construction in case you want to initialize a new object though the old one
//5.you should overload '=' in case you want to assign an object without initialization
//6.the overload function in 5 usually has self-check at first, then 'delete' statement, then others

//tips in 3:or you could initialize the pointer as NULL, that's because 'delete'(two forms either) can be used for a null pointer
