//if there is a statement follow

int A[2][3] = {1,2,3,4,5,6};

//then the value saved as follow
//            A[?][0]     A[?][1]    A[?][2]
// A[0][?]        1           2          3
// A[1][?]        4           5          6
//that means the first subscript is about the rows
//and the second is about the columns

//when you use a dereferencing operator to a pointer pointing to a two-dimension array
//like *A, it means A[0][3], still a pointer pointing to a normal array with 3 elements
//then *(A+1) is A[1][3]
//*(*(A+1)+1) is A[1][1] equals to 5
//that means when you want to get a value out of a two-dimension array though using dereferencing operator
//you must dereference it twice
